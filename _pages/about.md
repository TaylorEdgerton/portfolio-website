I enjoy the creation of digital media, websites and photography and growing up I have always had an interest in computers, how they work, and how software is created. Having an interest in building and programming web and mobile apps with the user in mind, I have decided to pursue this career further and I am currently in my last year of study at Griffith University, and have previously studied photography and design.

​
This website contains my resume and portfolio in order to gain more experience working for companies and with people who share my passion.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
